# CozmoCommander
Use the Anki Cozmo robot with a GUI. Uses Python with TkInter.

I am new to Cozmo, new to GUI programming and still new to Python. 
So this project is definitely not programmed in the most efficient or most elegant way. 
At the beginning I only wanted to find out how the world coordinate system works. 
By and by, the program got bigger and it is still growing. The "todo" grows faster that the "done" list. 

## What it does:
*************
CozmoCommander opens a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with optional viewers provided by the Cozmo SDK. 
You can control the Cozmo robot and its interaction with lightcubes and other objects. 
You can open a 2D map where the position of the robot is tracked and other objects are shown.
